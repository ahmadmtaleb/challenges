# Boolean 

- There are two possible values of this type => true and false 

The following values convert to 0, and therefore work like, **false**:  (**falsy values**)
- undefined
- null
- 0
- -0
- NaN
- ""

All other values, including **all objects (and arrays)** convert to, and work like, **true**

**An empty array [] is evaluated to true**

- Boolean values have a **toString()** method that you can use to convert them to the strings **“true” or “false”**, but they do not have any other useful methods.
